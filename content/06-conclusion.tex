\section{Conclusion}

Salient object detection in social media images involves distinct challenges due to the wide variation in content and formats. 
Existing methods provide a solid foundation, yet many are not directly tailored to the inconsistent and dynamic nature of social 
media data. A first prototype based on a zero shot approach demonstrates that salient objects can be segmented without task 
specific training, showing the potential of such models for this domain. However, the results also expose limitations in 
precision and consistency. Our future work will focus on improving the prototype and using the enhanced system to generate 
additional insights about social media content.
