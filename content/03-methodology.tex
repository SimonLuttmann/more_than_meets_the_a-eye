\section{Design Science Research Approach}

This research is based on the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) by \cite{peffers_design_2008}. 
It follows the framework in the five first activities to support the development of a pipeline 
which goal it is to improve the performace of image-to-text models on complex images used in social media context.

Identify \& Motivate = Introduction and Theoretical Background (Chapters \ref{ch01:intro} and \ref{ch02:theoretical})

Define Objectives of a Solution = BELOW: describe what the pipeline should fulfill

Design \& Development = BELOW: Planned Practical Steps, implementation in project phase

Demonstration \& Evaluation: To come in project phase
