\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch01:intro}

The topic of image segmentation is a field of interest in computer vision since the 1970s and remains highly relevant to this day. Recent advances in segmentation models enable point-based, zero-shot segmentation. By combining real eye-tracking data with such a model, we aim to create a practical approach for salient object detection for social media images that reflects actual human visual behaviour. Using gaze data directly as prompts, we aim to derive data-driven object masks that represent what was looked at most. Beyond developing a segmentation pipeline, we are motivated to illustrate what kinds of insights become possible once salient objects in those social media images can be reliably extracted. 

In existing literature, salient object detection has been implemented for specific use cases, but not within the social media context with its highly diverse and complex content. Therefore, research has not yet investigated what could be done with extracted salient objects in the social media context. Our work aims to provide an initial exploration of the research gap between social media, real human gaze behaviour and salient object detection.
